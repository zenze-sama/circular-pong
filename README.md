circular pong, what else?

This was actually meant for me to track how well I can make games in c++ with raylib, because my markov janken project turned out really good and I wanted to make a web version, so I needed some gui and later compile it to web assembly. However after making this, I am not doing all that. The library is pretty "limited" for my expectations and the compilation process didn't go as planned, 0 star review type shit. So I'll be making everything in pygame instead, its easier from there. If I were on linux maybe it have been easier but it is what it is.
